Localization
	KDEL - ER
	KKXX - transmembranal
	hydrophobic - n-terminal 5-30 aa - secretory pathway
	nls - 5 basic positively charged - KR[PAATKKAGQA]KKKK (bipartite) or K-K/R-X-K/R (monopartite)
	nes - LxxxLxxLxL, where "L" is a hydrophobic residue 
	mitochondrial - amphipathic helix at n-terminal
