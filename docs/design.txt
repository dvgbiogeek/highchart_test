Using Django, Tastypie, Angular and Highcharts

General Wants and Desires
Django 
Models, database

Tastypie for organizing the data to go into the db and for displaying on the frontend
	need to parse the data to go into the database


Angular form for data submission
	use a directive to use with highcharts

Highcharts displays the data 

Automate deployment using fabric - only for use on the server

Use logging to document bugs in the coding process and production

Brainstorming about Structure
Home page:
	welcome - 
	links to developments with the site - protein breakdown, blog thing, resources for information (NCBI for example)

Protein page	
	form for protein name and sequence 
		on sida add list of proteins already in the database
	Form as a directive/Django form
		if Django form - use python to parse the data prior to sending to the db or displaying data at a url
		if Angular - use javascript to remove whitespace and send through tastypie for displaying

Page for displaying data - charts
	start with showing amino acid breakdown
	extras - determine charge, determine potential phosporylation sites

Hidden url for storing JSON of data for the chart to access

Set up a blog like page with posts about the site
